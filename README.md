Hello friends,
I continue to improve myself with Unreal Engine 5. In this project, I designed a co-op adventure game. I used Unreal Engine 5.2.1 for this project. Throughout this course, I studied the fundamentals of designing multiplayer games in Unreal Engine and tried to grasp these concepts. Additionally, I created three puzzles on a pre-made map and customized the map to suit my needs.<br>
I hope my work will be useful to you. Thank you for checking out my project. Have a nice day and good luck with your work!
